Transfer learning is a deep learning technique that reuses a model trained on one task as a starting point for a new, related task. It accelerates training, requires less data, and improves performance by leveraging a pre-trained model's existing knowledge instead of starting from scratch. This is achieved by taking a model trained on a large dataset, freezing its initial layers (which learn general features), and retraining the final, task-specific layers with new data.
